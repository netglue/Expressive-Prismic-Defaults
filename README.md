# Expressive Prismic Website Defaults 'Module'

Note: As this is in the same namespace as the main `ExpressivePrismic` module, care must be taken to avoid namespace clashes.

## Goals/Todo

* Search Service
* Opinionated User-Land configuration using a bookmarked Prismic Document
* Opinionated generation of Link Lists (Think Navigation) and associated view helpers
* Easy way of mapping 'Slices' to view partials and rendering all of them with a single call to a view helper
* Middleware that sets various head meta defaults from the CMS configuration when none have been set on a per document basis
* Describe and implement a way to create and configure forms from the CMS
